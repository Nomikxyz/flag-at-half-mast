flag-at-half-mast
=================

This is a rewrite of the existing flag-at-half-mast project. 

Determine whether the United States flag is to be flown at half mast today. Uses the White House's public RSS stream to look through presidential proclamations. 

Note: This code isn't foolproof. This runs purely on some keywords I found in White House press releases relating to the flag being at half mast. If the White House decides to change these phrases for some reason, you'll need to update the code. There's no API (that I could find at least) that gives this information, but I'm hoping to include one with this project.

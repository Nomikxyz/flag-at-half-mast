flag-at-half-mast
=================

Determine whether the United States flag is to be flown at half mast today.

Note: This code isn't foolproof. This runs purely on some keywords I found in White House press releases relating to the flag being at half mast. If the White House decides to change these phrases for some reason, you'll need to update the code. There's no API (that I could find at least) that gives this information.

Some code borrowed from https://github.com/dwyl/node-parse-rss.
